1) DirectDraw is deprecated.However, we still use it (compatible with DX 7 and up).

The ddutil and dxutil files have been modified slightly to use wide char strings, making them compatible with the latest MS SDK, and using d3d9.h instead of d3d.h

ddraw.h is no longer a part of the DX SDK, but is part of the Windows SDK apparently. Therefore it works even with the latest DX SDK

ddraw.lib has been removed from the DX SDK. I copied an older version into its x86 lib directory and added it to the linker directories

winmm.lib needs to be added explicitly to the linked libraries in project settings. dxutil needs it.


It is probably better though to overhaul the dx part and use direct3d commands instead. ddraw is gradually disappearing.


2) For VSG and NI you need to download the SDKs and add both the include directory and the lib directory to the project properties.
The lib files themselves are added using a #pragma statement, you don't need to add them to project properties.
