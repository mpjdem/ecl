# ECL - the Eyetracker Code Library 

For archival purposes, this repo contains the final version of ECL, dated 2010-12-03. ECL was mainly used to program vision science experiments with analog Dual Purkinje Image eye trackers, using DirectX for stimulus presentation. Advances in technology have since made this approach obsolete, but the design of the library is such that it could support different eyetracking and display methods.

Documentation is provided in `doc/`, in the form of a draft manuscript and a manual, both based on slightly earlier versions of the software.

The code has not been tested since the final release, and is unlikely to work without issue on Windows versions newer than Vista.
